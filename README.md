## Introduction
This is a version of the classic Pong game, released by Atari back in 1972. It is a 2-player game where each player controls a paddle and continuously serves a ball to each other. A player scores a point if its opponent is unable to return the serve.

## Learning Outcomes
- OOP Concepts such as abstraction and inheritance. The game is broken down into smaller parts such as the paddles, the ball, and even the scoreboard, where each of them belong to a class each.
- Using Python Turtle graphics to render images and texts on the screen, to provide a stunning and interactive experience.
- General Python 3 programming proficiency.

## Future Work
Possible addition of background music and sound effects to further enhance the gaming experience. Possible addition of 'Start Game' and 'Game Over' pop-ups.
